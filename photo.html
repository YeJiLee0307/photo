  <h1>Photomontage</h1>

  <img src="photos.png" alt="Photomontage with dad's camera" class="photo" />

  <p>
    This is a photomontage created by combining the first photographs I took with my dad's film camera, which he used 30 years ago.
    The scenes captured through the viewfinder, seen through the eyes of a young man who was not yet a father, bring to life the memories of a time I never experienced,
    filled with shining but clumsy youth. The photographs taken with the film camera convey the emotions and feelings of that era as vividly as if I had hurriedly pressed pause on a video.
    Like my dad, I recorded these moments to pass on memories to someone else. That someone could be another person or even my future self.
